ToDo
====
This repository will be a collection of multiple learning fields where my desire is to combine several tools and technology.

# Algorithmic Development

1. Base algorithmic part will be written in C++
1. All of the functionality will be exposed by `pybind11` as my next target is to deploy the project as a web application
1. In the Backend maybe `Flask` will be used.
1. In the frontend `ReactJS` will be used. This part I have no idea still (Nov 6, 2022)
1. To deal with data hopefully `Database` will be used.
1. Complete project will be hosted in `AWS` which also depends how much I can afford
1. To pass data between Backend and Frontend which technology will be used also a matter of thinking (Right now as embedded software developer I know about `gRPC`, `Protocol Buffers`)

# Automation

1. Project will be build by `Github Action`
1. Also check the regular update of the dependant repository (Here till now `pybind11`)

# Documentation

1. Use `Sphinx` as documentation tool
1. Also provide `Doxygen` style comment in the header file of `C++`
1. Host the document in `readthedocs`

# Delivery

1. Use `Docker` to pack the whole product. By the way, is it necessary?
